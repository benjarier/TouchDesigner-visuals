# TouchDesigner-visuals
This is repository containing the code and examples of some of the TouchDesigner projects and visuals I post on Instagram [@benjarier](https://instagram.com/benjarier).

## Content
1. [Travelling lights](https://www.instagram.com/p/BwmFa_nDhFJ/) [*[Code](https://github.com/benjarier/TouchDesigner-visuals/tree/master/Travelling%20Lights)*] uses a replicator operator and a little bit of scripting to create the illusion of lines of light moving over mountains.
2. [Intro to touch](https://github.com/benjarier/TouchDesigner-visuals/tree/master/Intro%20to%20touch) Code for a small workshop on TouchDesigner.
3. More coming soon ...
